# Scitype for arrays

"""
    Scitype(T, C)

Method for implementers of a convention `C` to enable speed-up of
scitype evaluations for arrays.

In general, one cannot infer the scitype of an object of type
`AbstractArray{T, N}` from the machine type alone. For, example, this
never holds in the *MLJ* convention for a categorical array, or in the
following examples: `X=Any[1, 2, 3]` and `X=Union{Missing,Int64}[1, 2, 3]`.

Nevertheless, for some *restricted* machine types `U`, the statement
`type(X) == AbstractArray{T, N}` for some `T<:U` already allows one
deduce that `scitype(X) = AbstractArray{S,N}`, where `S` is determined
by `U` alone. This is the case in the *MLJ* convention, for example,
if `U = Integer`, in which case `S = Count`. If one explicitly declares

```
Scitype(::Type{<:U}, ::C) = S
```

in such cases, then ScientificTypes ensures a considerable speed-up in
the computation of `scitype(X)`. There is also a partial speed-up for
the case that `T <: Union{U, Missing}`.

For example, in the *MLJ* convention, one has

```
Scitype(::Type{<:Integer}, ::MLJ) = Count
```

"true missing values", otherwise it constructs a "tight copy" of the array

    elscitype(A)

Return the scitype of elements of A. Unlike `scitype_union`, this does, in
general, not check the scitype of each element, rather it takes the global
scitype which is `AbstractArray{T,N}` and extracts the element scitype from
the `T`. Note however that, in some corner cases, `scitype` does check all
elements in which case `elscitype` also will.
