For a column `col` with element type `type` and `nrows` rows, check if there are relatively
few values as compared to the number of rows. The heuristic for "few" is as follows:

1. there's ≤ 3 unique values with more than 5 rows, use the `MultiClass{N}` type
2. there's less than 10% unique values out of the number of rows **or** there's fewer than
    100 unique values (whichever one is smaller):
        a. if it's a Real type, return as `OrderedFactor`
        b. if it's something else (e.g. a `String`) return as `MultiClass{N}`
